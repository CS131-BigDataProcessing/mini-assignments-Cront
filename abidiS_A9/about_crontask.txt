Automating tasks like database maintenance (e.g., regular backups or indexing) and system monitoring (e.g., checking disk space or CPU load) can streamline operations and improve efficiency. However, poorly managed automation poses risks such as system failures, data corruption, or resource overuse. To mitigate these risks, ensure thorough testing of scripts, implement error logging, schedule regular reviews of automated processes, and verify that critical tasks like backups are functioning correctly.
